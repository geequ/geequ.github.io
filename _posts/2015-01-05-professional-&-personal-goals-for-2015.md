title: Professional & Personal Goals for 2015
---

### Improve my english
In this year my main goal is quite increase my knowledge about english language. I have at least 2 good reasons for learn this:

* I'm a programmer, so as you know for sure, all the best resources are writing in english language
* I don't know where I want to live when I will be for example 40

I guess that I should work on every aspect of my english, but in other hand I think that I won't enough time and discipline. So I assume two main elements: dictionary and grammar. 
My plan for learning is very simply and rather traditionally. First, I have 3 times in every week online english lessons. This isn't off course enough, but I think this will be good for speaking training. So I will plan in prepare material of the whole next week every Sunday by reading a lesson from one of my wife books. I will use also flashcards. I think about 2 hours daily is definitely enough. Additionally I should as regularly as possible add posts to this blog.

### Prepare for Zend PHP certificate exam
One of my big love in my life is programming. I know more or less any languages than php like Javascript, C#, Java, C++ but my cup of tea is PHP. So i just think that this is natural decision. I heard that many people said that this is for nothing or this knowledge isn't pragmatic and I probably never use quite most of this knowledge, but I think this is not whole true. I think that every PHP programmer should at least read once the complete manual.

### Improve programming skills
I think primarly about OOP programming, so I will write at least one small application and this will be probably Sudoku solver. I think I can use all of my knowledge about OOP, DDD, TDD and algorithms. After this I think about rewrite this for C++. Another aspect which I want familiar is Javascript. I think seriously about this language, because I haven't any tool to show my work results. And lastly hated regexp ;-)

### Build quadrocopter
I think about build my own quadrocopter from scratch. Actually I don't have any knowledge about this, so firstly I'm making some research and try to assess project cost.

### Lose ~20kg
Actually my weight is about 100kg. Now (from today) I'm on diet, so assuming lose about 4kg for every month for holidays time I should have correct weight. I hope!
