title: Professional & Personal Goals for 2015
---

### Improve my english
In this year my main goal is to increase my knowledge about the English language. I have at least 2 good reasons to learn this:

* I'm a programmer, so as you know for sure, all the best resources are writing in English
* I don't know where I want to live when I'm for example 40

I guess that I should work on every language skill, but on the other hand I think that I won't have enough time and selfdiscipline. So I assume that I should choose two main elements: vocabulary and grammar. 
My plan for learning is very simple and rather traditional. First, I have 3 online English lessons weekly. This isn't of course enough, but I think it will be good for speaking training. I plan to prepare materials for the following week on Sunday by reading a lesson from one of my wife's books. I will also use flashcards. I think about 2 hours daily is definitely enough. Additionally I should add posts to this blog as regularly as possible.

### Prepare for Zend PHP certificate exam
One of my big love in my life is programming. I briefly know other languages such as Javascript, C#, Java, C++ but my cup of tea is PHP. So I just think that it is a natural decision. I heard that many people said that it is for nothing or this knowledge isn't pragmatic and I probably never use quite most of this knowledge, but I think this is not the whole truth. I think that every PHP programmer should at least read the complete manual once in life.

### Improve programming skills
I think primarly about OOP programming, so I will write at least one small application and this will be probably Sudoku solver. I think I can use all of my knowledge about OOP, DDD, TDD and algorithms. After this I think about rewriting this for C++. Another aspect which I want to be familiar with is Javascript. I seriously think about this language, because I haven't got any tool to show my work results. And at last hated regexp ;-)

### Build quadrocopter
I think about building my own quadrocopter from scratch. Actually I don't have any knowledge about this, so firstly I'm making some research and trying to assess project cost.

### Lose ~20kg
Actually my weight is about 100kg. Now (from today) I'm on diet, so I assume if I loose about 4kg for every month until holidays time I should have correct weight. I hope!
